Sebastian Russo's Portfolio 

I've been studying for a year in HTML, CSS, jQuery, React.js/Redux, and Node.js. 

I've displayed three projects, each unique in what languages it uses and goal of the project. 

'Personal Menu' showcases my skills in React.js/Redux.

'Ultimate Budgeter' showcases my skills with jQuery. 

'Pokémon Pokédex' showcases my skills with jQuery in terms of API requests and data manipulation. 

Of course all use CSS as well.
