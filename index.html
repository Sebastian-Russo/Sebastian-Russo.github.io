            <p>A little about me:</p>
            <h3>I left my old job and my old life...</h3>
            <p>Not the normal intro most developers have, growing up building computers... I spent almost a full decade, successfully in sales. Then spent the better part of a year traveling in Asia. Partly to see the world, and partly to see what interested me out there besides sales. I came back to America with my mind set on coding. A year later, during Covid-19, with the help of a friend, I've taught myself: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js/Redux, and Node.js
            </p>
            <h3>Why coding...</h3>
            <p>What drew me to coding was the project work of creating something, and bit by bit, seeing it come together and alive. The continuous ability to learn something new each day. Just imagining how much more I'll learn and create in the next 5 and 10 years, has fulfilling effect to look forward to. Whether it be for a company I enjoy working with, and being a part of building something bigger. Or, on my own, and creating something I've visualized in my head, and bringing it to life.
