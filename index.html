            <p>A little about me:</p>
            <h3>I left my old career and my old life...</h3>
            <p>I had spent the better part of a year traveling through Asia to see the world and discover alternative passions. After speaking with many different travelers, all diverse in origin and tongue, the language I fell in love with most was computers. I came back to America with my mind set on coding. A year later, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and with the help of a good friend (and a lot of self-motivation), I've taught myself: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js/Redux, and Node.js
            </p>
            <h3>Why coding...</h3>
            <p>What draws me to coding is the opportunity to take ideas, create projects and, bit by bit, see them come to life. I embrace the daily challenge of learning something new in an ever-expanding and highly evolving field. Within the next 5 to 10 years I can only imagine how much more I will learn and create, given how much I’ve been able to accomplish in one year.
            <br>
            I look forward to contributing to the art of coding whether that be as a team member with a promising company or independently…transforming the limitless ideas in my mind into reality.
